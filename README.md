# 🧠 AttriSense – Predicting Employee Attrition with Explainable AI

## 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether an employee will leave the company and explains why, using IBM's HR dataset.

## 💼 Business Goal
Help HR teams identify at-risk employees early and understand key factors behind attrition.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- SHAP for explainability
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 87%
- ROC-AUC: 0.77
- F1-Score (Attrition class): 0.40

## 📈 Top Features (SHAP)
- Overtime
- Monthly Income
- Stock Option Level
- Distance From Home
- Job Satisfaction

## 🧠 Key HR Insights
- Employees working overtime are more likely to leave.
- Low income and lack of stock options increase attrition.
- Long commutes and low satisfaction contribute to churn.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Reduce overtime hours
- Offer performance-based incentives
- Support remote work options
- Monitor satisfaction via pulse surveys
